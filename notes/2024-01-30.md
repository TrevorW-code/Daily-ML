Not the most exciting Video (it's just linear algebra concepts), but it should be *practically speaking* the most useful for review. Let's get started.

### Matrix Equations

We need to know this!

[[Matrix Multiplication]] - The most critical piece!

Imagine you have a seat at a concert, and for some reason, the performer wants to flip the entire stage. For you to find your new seat, you will need to do a linear transformation.

**Terminology alert!** 
### [[Linear Transformations]]
- Only multiply and Add Stuff
- Constant Change in Input = Constant Change in output
- Slope is always the same

Matrix Algebra is especially useful for linear transformations!
#### Linear Transformation in Matrix Form
- Row Matrix / Row Vector

- Take the transformations and convert them into matricies

#### Matrix Multiplication
- Multiply Row by Columns

Here's a table view

| num1 | num2 |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | 1 |

X

| col1 | col2 |
| ---- | ---- |
| -1 | 0 |
| 0 | -1 |

= ( **2** *num1* x **-1** *col1,row1* ) + ( **1** *num2* x **0** *col1, row2*) = -2
= ( **2** *num1* x 0 *col2,row1* ) + ( **1** *num2* x **-1** *col2, row2*) = -1

We multiply Row by Column!
- 1st row, 1st col
- 2nd row, 2nd col

Matrix Multiplication is really nice because it can combine transformations in ONE matrix.

In general, the number of columns in the first matrix has to match the number of rows in the second matrix.

**Terminology alert!** 
- Changing rows to cols is a Transpose (superscript T)

Row x Col = format

1 x 2 = Array
2 x 1 = Stacked Column

### Common Conventions

- Matrices with only one row or column are usually referred to with lowercase letter that are *sometimes* italicized, sometimes not.
- Matrices with more than 1 row and column are usually referred to with uppercase letters that are also *sometimes* italicized, sometimes not.

Here's an example:

We can also right the same thing in Transpose:

How does this apply to a neural network?

Essentially, using matrix multiplication + bias term + activation function, you can use the weights learned by a model to transform matrix operations into predictions.

Look at it with substituted values!
